# archer-controller
Kubernetes Controller for synchronizing Kubernetes Services to [Archer](https://github.com/sapcc/archer) Endpoint Services.

## Description
This is a simple implementation of an Kubernetes Controller that watches for Kubernetes Services with a specific annotation and creates or updates the corresponding Archer Endpoint Service.

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/archer-controller:tag
```

2. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/archer-controller:tag
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Configuration
The controller can be configured via the following parameters:
```sh
Usage of ./archer-controller:
  -health-probe-bind-address string
    	The address the probe endpoint binds to. (default ":8081")
  -kubeconfig string
    	Paths to a kubeconfig. Only required if out-of-cluster.
  -leader-elect
    	Enable leader election for controller manager. Enabling this will ensure there is only one active controller manager.
  -metrics-bind-address string
    	The address the metric endpoint binds to. (default ":8080")
  -network-id string
    	The ID of the network to use for the service endpoint.
  -zap-devel
    	Development Mode defaults(encoder=consoleEncoder,logLevel=Debug,stackTraceLevel=Warn). Production Mode defaults(encoder=jsonEncoder,logLevel=Info,stackTraceLevel=Error) (default true)
  -zap-encoder value
    	Zap log encoding (one of 'json' or 'console')
  -zap-log-level value
    	Zap Level to configure the verbosity of logging. Can be one of 'debug', 'info', 'error', or any integer value > 0 which corresponds to custom debug levels of increasing verbosity
  -zap-stacktrace-level value
    	Zap Level at and above which stacktraces are captured (one of 'info', 'error', 'panic').
  -zap-time-encoding value
    	Zap time encoding (one of 'epoch', 'millis', 'nano', 'iso8601', 'rfc3339' or 'rfc3339nano'). Defaults to 'epoch'.
```

## Usage
The controller watches for Kubernetes Services with the following annotation:
```yaml
cloud.sap/archer-create: true
    Boolean indicating whether a endpoint service needs to be created.
    Required.
cloud.sap/archer-network-id: <network-id>
    The ID of the network to use for the service.
    Optional.
cloud.sap/archer-service-name: <service-name>
    String specifying the name of the endpont service resource to be created.
    Defaults to the name of the service.
cloud.sap/archer-proxy-protocol: [true|false]
    Boolean indicating whether the endpoint service should use the proxy protocol.
    Defaults to false.
cloud.sap/archer-visibility: [public|private]
    String specifying the visibility of the endpoint service.
    Defaults to public.
cloud.sap/archer-require-approval: [true|false]
    Boolean indicating whether the endpoint service should require approval.
    Defaults to false.
cloud.sap/archer-tags: <tag1>,<tag2>,...
    Comma separated list of tags to be added to the endpoint service.
    Optional.
cloud.sap/archer-availability-zone: <availability-zone>
    String specifying the availability zone of the endpoint service.
    Optional.
cloud.sap/archer-port: <port>
    Integer specifying the IP port of the endpoint service.
    Optional.
```

Example:
```sh
kubectl create service clusterip --tcp 2345 test
kubectl annotate service test cloud.sap/archer-create="true"
```

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
